Describe how to address individual components of read lines in ABAP using component selectors, ASSIGN statements, and data reference variables

CODE:
DATA(comp1) = it[ b = 2 ]-c.

READ TABLE it INTO DATA(wa) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp2) = wa-c.

READ TABLE it ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<fs>) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp3) = <fs>-c.

READ TABLE it REFERENCE INTO DATA(dref) WITH KEY b = 2.
DATA(comp4) = dref->c.

DATA(comp5) = dref->*-c.
